# steeringSandbox

Online flocking simulation, based on the idea of combining simple steering behaviours to achieve complex group behaviour. 

Influenced by the work of Craig Reynolds (http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/).

## Instructions
Go to the online sandbox:  http://vladamakaric.github.io/steeringSandbox/
By default there is only one entity (boid) moving towards a goal.
To add more boids to the simulation select the radio button for Add boid and left click in the sanbox. 
You can also change the goal of all the boids in a similar way, using the radio buttons and left clicking.
